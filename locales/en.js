We were very nervous starting our new Brokerage but DocEM has supported and guided us all the way. We really thank DocEM for their continued support and the improvements that they are making in the software based on the feedback from us and RECO. We wish DocEM continued growth and hope their team will keep up the service standards that we have become so used to.',

Now with hundreds of agents and a higher volume of transactions, we could not operate without it.  We take full advantage of the capabilities offer by the software.  It definitely improves and simplifies our processes.   They keep innovating rapidly and meeting our specific demands.  They are always available to support our team.',
